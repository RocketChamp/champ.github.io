# 21 Game

During my internship, I developed a card game using vanilla JavaScript to understand DOM manipulation and HTML/CSS basics. This hands-on experience helped me appreciate the power of frameworks like React that simplify similar tasks.

## Challenges
- Writing clean, maintainable code without frameworks.
- Handling dynamic DOM updates efficiently.

## Outcome
The game was a success and became a foundation for my understanding of frontend development.
