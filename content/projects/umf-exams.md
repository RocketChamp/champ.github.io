# UMF Exams


At a local software company, I refactored an exam management platform for a university using Vue 2 and Vuetify.

## Challenges
- Implementing Vuetify to standardize UI components.
- Improving maintainability and code readability.

## Outcome
The platform became more maintainable and visually cohesive.
