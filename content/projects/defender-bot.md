# Defender Bot


As part of an exchange program in Funchal, Madeira, I developed a LEGO robot controlled using Python. 
The robot was programmed to compete in a turn-based game by reacting to external stimuli via sensors.

## Challenges
- Implementing AI decision-making in a game scenario.
- Learning Python OOP and integrating it with hardware.

## Outcome
This project sparked my interest in robotics and AI-based control systems.
