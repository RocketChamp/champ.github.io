# ML AdCognition


Developed an AI model using TensorFlow to detect advertisements in images, as an alternative to filter-based blocking.

## Challenges
- Training a model with diverse ad and non-ad datasets.
- Developing a web interface to trigger model training remotely.

## Outcome
The project successfully proved that ad detection via image recognition is feasible.
