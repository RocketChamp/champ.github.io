# RoboGPT


Developed a research project using Isaac Sim to control a forklift in a warehouse environment via natural language.

## Challenges
- Integrating LLMs for command interpretation.
- Implementing a Factory pattern for different LLM APIs.

## Outcome
The project enhanced my experience in 3D engines, async programming, and AI-driven automation.
