# OTIS


While working as a Support Agent, I developed OTIS, a tool to automate form-filling from Excel templates.
It greatly reduced manual work and won first place in an Innovation Competition.

## Challenges
- Creating a standalone HTML file with all dependencies included.
- Using regex to dynamically populate form fields.

## Outcome
OTIS improved efficiency in the workplace and earned me a bonus, which I used to buy my first MacBook Air M1.
