# IT Hub


For my graduation project, I developed a social media application using the MERN stack. 
This project gave me hands-on experience in full-stack web development.

## Challenges
- Building a scalable backend with Node.js and Express.
- Managing state and UI complexity in React.

## Outcome
The project deepened my understanding of full-stack development and prepared me for professional roles.
